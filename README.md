## Features

### ðŸš€ Supercharge Your Development
Erl helps you:
- Generate high-quality code based on your prompts.
- Create an initial review of the generated code with AI insights.
- Extract files and represent them as JSON for easy integration and manipulation.

### ðŸ›  Locally Built API
This project includes a locally-hosted API to:
1. **Extract Files as JSON**: Transform files into JSON representations using your custom prompts.
2. **Code Review Endpoint**: Generate detailed AI reviews of your code for best practices, potential improvements, and optimization tips.

### ðŸ”¬ Explore AI and Data Manipulation
Erl provides a hands-on experience to:
- Understand how AI language models (LLMs) operate at the data manipulation level.
- Experiment with the integration of AI into real-world development pipelines.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to get Erl up and running on your local machine:

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone <repository_url>
cd erl-code-generator
```

### 2. Prepare to Launch
Set up the necessary permissions for the script:
```bash
chmod 700 run.sh
```
You will need to ensure you have an OPENAI_API_KEY, a GITHUB_TOKEN, and a GITHUB_USER defined as an environment variables.
`export OPENAI_API_KEY="VALUE"`
`export GITHUB_USER="VALUE"`
`export GITHUB_TOKEN="VALUE"`

Important: You will need to buy Open AI credits to run this

### 3. Launch the Process
Run the script to start the API and initialize Erl:
```bash
./run.sh
```

The API will now be live and ready to assist you with code generation and review tasks.

## How It Works

### File Extraction Endpoint
Submit a file and a prompt to extract meaningful data or transform the file into JSON format. Perfect for structured file manipulation and API integrations.

### Code Review Endpoint
Send your code to this endpoint, and Erl will:
- Analyze it for best practices.
- Suggest improvements and optimizations.
- Identify potential issues and solutions.

## Why Erl?
Erl is more than a projectâ€”it's an exploration of how artificial intelligence can transform software development. By examining the relationship between LLMs and data manipulation, Erl offers:
- Insights into the capabilities and limitations of AI in coding tasks.
- A foundation for integrating AI into your development toolkit.
